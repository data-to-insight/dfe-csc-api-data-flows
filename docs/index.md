# CSC API Dataflow (D2I Solution)
Author: Data to Insight | Last Updated: 250225 | Draft

## API Introduction
CSC API dataflow project with D2I, aims to automate the transfer of Children's Social Care(CSC) data, from pilot Local Authorities (LAs) to an agreed API endpoint using a scripted solution in combination with the deployed SSD schema. 

By deploying the Standard Safeguarding Dataset (SSD) as middleware; the data flow automation includes generation of a JSON structured extract from the SSD data layer, sent via a supplied API process to the defined endpoint.

## Standard Safeguarding Dataset (SSD)

In response to the 2022 independent review of children’s social care (“the MacAlister review”), DfE initiated a whole-system response in the form of a consultation response, revised practice guidance, and a range of innovation projects across practice and enabling technologies. The Data and Digital 
Solutions Fund (DDSF) marked a significant element in this initial response, formalising government’s commitment to “put Local Authorities in the driving seat of change”.

The Standard Safeguarding Dataset (SSD) represents one of the DDSF’s major products: a sector-designed dataset specification for production by any LA, which can improve sector collaboration, help LAs generate insights, and ease data interoperability between local and national government.

The Standard Safeguarding Dataset is broader in scope than existing statutory data returns, more useful to local authorities (LAs), and easy to deploy for most LAs using the major current case management software solutions. Partners/pilot and early-adopter LA's deploying this solution have the additional benefits of concurrent compatibility testing and deployment of the SSD in combination with the data flow automation.
