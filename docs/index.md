## Introduction
CSC API dataflow project, with D2I, aims to automate the transfer of Children's Social Care (CSC) data, from pilot Local Authorities (LAs) to an agreed API endpoint. 
Using the Standard Safeguarding Dataset (SSD) as middleware; the data flow automation includes generation of a JSON structured extract from the SSD data layer, sent via a supplied API process to the defined endpoint.
