# CSC API Pipeline

A Python-based tool for submitting structured social care JSON payloads to the DfE Children‚Äôs Social Care (CSC) API. Designed to run locally, as a Windows `.exe` or via scheduled job (as part of LA overnight batches in either of those formats)

---

## üöÄ Features

- Extracts data from a SQL Server staging table
- Generates full or partial JSON payloads based on change detection
- Authenticates via OAuth2 client credentials flow
- Submits payloads to an API endpoint with retry and backoff logic
- Logs responses and updates submission state in SQL
- Offers `.exe` packaging for offline deployment
- Includes CLI tools for test and verification modes
- Publishes technical documentation using MkDocs with Mermaid and PDF export

---

## üì¶ Installation

Clone the repo and install using Python 3.11 or later:

```bash
pip install .
```

Or run directly as a module:

```bash
python -m api_pipeline run
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file based on the included template:

```env
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER=server;DATABASE=db;UID=user;PWD=password
TOKEN_ENDPOINT=https://your-auth-server.com/token
API_ENDPOINT=https://your-api.com/data
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

SUPPLIER_KEY=your_supplier_key
DEBUG=true
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Pipeline

### As a Python module:

```bash
python -m api_pipeline run
```

### As a packaged `.exe`:

```bash
csc_api_pipeline.exe
```

---

## üß™ CLI Test Commands

Run local diagnostics:

```bash
python -m api_pipeline test-endpoint
python -m api_pipeline test-db
python -m api_pipeline test-schema
```

Or from the executable:

```bash
csc_api_pipeline.exe test-endpoint
csc_api_pipeline.exe test-db
```

---

## ‚ùì CLI Help

```bash
csc_api_pipeline.exe --help
```

Returns:

```
CSC API Pipeline CLI

Usage:
  csc_api_pipeline.exe [command]

Commands:
  run             Run the full API submission process
  test-endpoint   Check API connectivity and token authentication
  test-db         Check database connection
  test-schema     Validate required table structure/schema
```

---

## üìñ Documentation

Documentation is maintained in the `docs/` folder and built using MkDocs.

### View locally:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

### Build static site:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

### Export as PDF:

```bash
mkdocs-with-pdf build
```

Documentation supports Mermaid diagrams and code highlighting. Output is auto-deployed using GitHub Pages via Actions.

---

## üåê GitHub Pages Deployment

Uses native GitHub Actions Pages deployment.

Workflow location:

```text
.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml
```

Triggers on push to `main`, builds site using MkDocs, and uploads as GitHub Pages artifact. Pages are published under `Settings ‚Üí Pages`.

No manual push to `gh-pages` required.

---

## üîÅ Release Process

Run the release helper:

```bash
./release.sh
```

- Builds `.whl` and `.tar.gz` for PyPI
- Optionally builds `.exe` for Windows
- Tags commit and pushes to GitHub
- Creates `release.zip` bundle

### Submission Flow (per record)

```mermaid

    participant DB as SQL Server
    participant App as CSC API Pipeline
    participant Auth as OAuth Server
    participant API as CSC API

    DB->>App: Select records (where status = pending or error)
    App->>Auth: Request OAuth2 token
    Auth-->>App: Access token
    App->>API: POST JSON payload
    API-->>App: 200 OK / error
    App->>DB: Update submission_status<br>e.g. 'sent', 'error'
    Note right of App: On success, copy json_payload ‚Üí previous_json_payload
```

### Status Reference Table

| Event                            | `submission_status` | `row_state` |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Initial load (new record)        | pending              | new         |
| JSON modified (hash mismatch)    | pending              | updated     |
| API success                      | sent                 | unchanged   |
| API failure (retry exhausted)    | error                | unchanged   |
| Record deleted in source system | pending              | deleted     |

## üí° Development Notes

- Run using `python -m api_pipeline` in dev
- Maintain `.env` in root for local config
- Build Windows executable using:

```bash
pyinstaller api_pipeline/entry_point.py --onefile --name csc_api_pipeline
```

- Check environment before release:

```bash
gitleaks detect --no-git --source=. --report-path=current_only.json
```
