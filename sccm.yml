    A D2I solution for extracting standardised Children’s Social Care (CSC) data from Local Authorities’ Case Management Systems (CMS),
    transforming it into a Standard Safeguarding Dataset (SSD), and transmitting it daily to the Department for Education’s (DfE) CSC API
    for benchmarking, insight, and sector learning.

# --- SCCM Concept Type Reference (based on PAS 182) ---
# Use the following as values for `type:` fields in sccm_alignment entities.

# ITEM GROUPS
# --------------------------------------------
# AGENT         : PERSON or ORGANIZATION that provides services or acts in an EVENT 
# ITEM          : discrete thing (can be physical or abstract)
# ABSTRACT      : Non-physical ITEM (e.g. SERVICE, CASE, OBJECTIVE, RULE)
# OBJECT        : physical ITEM (e.g. building, sensor, road)
# COLLECTION    : grouping of ITEMs (e.g. dashboard, summary, dataset)

# CONCEPT TYPES (Main concepts)
# --------------------------------------------
# PERSON        : An individual human being
# ORGANIZATION  : group of persons with shared goal (e.g. LA, NHS Trust)
# PLACE         : geographic position or region (e.g. LA area, postcode)
# SERVICE       : The capability to carry out a function/method (e.g. social care)
# EVENT         : Something that happens (e.g. inspection, application)
# STATE         : condition or circumstance of an ITEM (e.g. judgement outcome)
# OBSERVATION   : type of EVENT in which STATE is recorded (e.g. score, grade)
# PLAN          : Steps with resources and times to reach target state
# CASE          : container of EVENTs arising from SERVICE usage (e.g. care case)
# METHOD        : defined procedure to carry out task (e.g. data scrape, triage)
# OBJECTIVE     : desired outcome (e.g. improve housing, reduce risk)
# TARGET        : desired future STATE
# RESOURCE      : An ITEM used by an AGENT to deliver SERVICE (e.g. funding, people)
# AGREEMENT     : An arrangement between AGENTs (e.g. contract, MOU)
# ACCOUNT       : record of EVENTs related to an ITEM (e.g. care history)

# OTHER USEFUL TYPES
# --------------------------------------------
# COMMUNITY     : group of PERSONs/ORGANIZATIONs sharing traits or goals (e.g. LIIA)
# FUNCTION      : COLLECTION of SERVICEs grouped for purpose (e.g. child protection)
# RULE          : regulation or constraint (e.g. legislation, eligibility)
# DECISION      : conclusion reached by an AGENT
# ASSUMPTION    : forecast or expected STATE used for planning

# Note: These types are semantic labels — spelling must match exactly (e.g. ORGANIZATION not Organisation).
